[<p>It is very amazing course for beginners as well as intermediates.</p>]
[<p>Zaid and the folks at Z security are class acts and always available for any questions. I prefer them over any other tutorials for their over simplified explanations and patience and understanding of the fact that we are not all seasoned professionals. We are a great team and Zaid has helped me to grow as an ethical hacker.</p>]
[<p>love it could do with updating a little but overall very good course im improving so its working</p>]
"[<p>Course was good and it provides nice insight, however most of this cod cant be used in 2023 since it's outdated.</p>]"
"[<p>Although the content of the course is really good, there are several issues I'd like to highlight:</p>, <p>* the code is focused on deprecated Python 2. There are sections to update the code to Python 3, but having deprecated version of programming language is not what I would expect</p>, <p>* lots of URLs in examples from first 10 sections are not working anymore, course content is not updated. You have to search through Q&amp;A section and all around the Internet to determine whether you made a typo in your code or website is more strict in security and the code simply doesn't work anymore</p>, <p>* sources are not available, you have to follow and code with teacher. Combining with bullet above it's a mystery when you can't reproduce website hacking and takes really lots of time to find the root cause.</p>]"
"[<p>Very nice presentation of networking principles, using simple python.</p>, <p>Perfect for newcomers into programming, but also giving a lot food for thought for more experienced programmers!!</p>]"
[<p>Awesome course.  Learnt loads and the support in the Q&amp;A section is quick and very helpful.  I can heartily recommend this course</p>]
[<p>I'm a newbie in programming and so far it has been very easy to follow. In case I don't understand I just re-watch the videos and get the explanation in a better way.</p>]
"[<p>It has been a fantastic match for me and even though some things have changed, it is still an incredible and informative course. Much better than any other instruction I have had the pleasure to learn.</p>]"
[<p>Amazing content to put all the learned methodology together.</p>]
"[<p>some exploits do not work as intended, maybe outdated or deprecated libraries</p>, <p>edit: errors may have been caused because of my test environment. Zaid is always available to help with troubleshooting issues. very good support and I was told that the course is regularly updated.</p>]"
"[<p>the instructor is very good explains everything step by step and in an easy way he wants that every detail is understand by the students, he did a very good job!</p>]"
