It takes me hours to get through some lectures because programs just do not work due to the code taught being outdated.

You have to search through Q&A section and all around the Internet to determine whether you made a typo in your code or website is more strict in security and the code simply doesn't work anymore\n* sources are not available, you have to follow and code with teacher.

Even some libraries couldn't be installed on Kali, but working in Ubuntu. So, at the end, I gave up on Kali virtual machine and just used my own Ubuntu machine.\n\nAnyway, I already applied for the Zaid's other courses, just hope python 3 will be the mainly used.",

This class I take notes because I'm actually doing something and I WANT to remember this. \n\nAnyone who has ever wanted to learn coding but was afraid of or didn't want to do a school setting or think they wouldn't be able to teach themselves (all me) AND sees python as where they want to start; should purchase this. It's an amazing intro into coding with python as well as giving it utility, and as someone who only knew SUPER basic terminology (almost none) and only how to put physical systems together, AND essentially zero coding experience, it is an easy to follow foot in the door to the subject.",

        "review": "This course was awesome. This course was amazing. Fair warning- it takes time and dedication to really get the focus necessary to grasp the concepts in this. If you don't have sufficient time to invest, this course will probably not work for you, or you won't get the most out of it. It took me at least a couple months (I wasn't keeping track) and I was studying it almost every night with what time I had available (ave 2-3 hours). It will save time if you are already pretty good at coding. I was definitely a beginner programmer in python, although not an absolute beginner because I had some concepts down, some simple VBA and a course I once took in college, but I never really truly programmed, nor used python. \n\nI learned so much in this course. I learned of course so much about Security and I learned so much about Python. Like I said I didn't know anything about python before. I didn't know about object oriented programming or classes, though I knew it was something that existed and that I wanted to learn. I cannot learn well by theory alone, so this course was great because I got to see what objects are in practice, not from a lecture, but through actual lines of code. I also learned a lot about security and vulnerabilities. I'm definitely going to take his other courses. \n\nOne year ago I knew very little about computers. Since then I have taken several courses here on udemy and plan to continue. I've taken Mike Meyer's CompTia A+ and Network+ to get a grounding with the intent to continue on to more advanced courses in other areas, and I also am taking his Security+ course, though I took/am taking all of these more passively, listening while I drive. They form and formed a good foundation so you understand what's going on but this course on Python and Ethical hacking cannot be taken passively! I would actually often detour from the lesson to go research a concept he talked about or that was linked in some way with the lesson. \n\nBut besides python and security, I learned a lot about Linux, both in general and in it's Kali manifestation. I also beefed up my scant knowledge  of VirtualBox/Virtualization and of Networking, setting up a server, and even got a toehold into HTML and JS- all stuff I want to go on to learn. I am so happy too that I made the switch to Linux. I am now a *Nix guy. I'm done with those other two OSs, to the extent possible. I started this course with my Best Buy computer, which is not crappy but is small with low storage- a 128GB SSD and an I3. I thought it was decent at the time but I did not intend it for anything. Then I bought an old but formerly advanced business computer on sale that was dated- a mere 4GB ram but with Windows 10. I learned how to dual boot that one with windows and Kali on the same drive. It was funny how much faster Kali went on the same machine compared to windows, though it was still too slow. I decided it's easier and more fun to learn when you have better equipment, so I bought a gaming laptop, though I'm not a gamer, on ebay: The most powerful machine I've ever owned, 16gb an I7 6th gen I think- 8 logical cores, and I installed on it a 500GB SSD (that also was a new experience for me). I installed Kali again on that and then installed the Kali virtual machine as well as other virtualmachines as suggested in the course. It was interesting because my computer has an NVIDIA graphics card and it doesn't play nice with Kali so each time I boot up I have to manually disable it in the startup script. Just figuring that out was a little victory for me. Trying to install a new driver crashed my machine before so it wouldn't boot, so I'm fine with this for the future- it's an added layer of security that someone would have to get through to get at my machine! But my main regret about the computer I bought is it's *only* 15 in, and the lighter plastic style, rather than 17in heavier bodied. Huge problems I know. I'm just sharing all this because all of this happened in the context of the course on my path to completing it. I had this good computer for most of it, just not at the beginning, and that makes a huge difference. I'd say you probably need at least 8GB ram if you're going to run a virtual machine. I also think it's kind of a good idea to lay a basic foundation but at the same time it's also good to tackle the harder subjects first. I feel like if I take other security and hacking courses- which I will, both from Zaid and from others, they won't be as challenging as this- not that it was challenging but it was time requiring and demanding of focus and attention to detail. This is a good place for me to be at now because maybe it will be more downhill from here. I plan though to take a python and AI course soon. I want to reinforce and strengthen my python skills. Now I just have to find useful applications for my growing skills. I like it because it's an intellectual challenge, like chess, but unlike chess, has much more utility. \n\nAlso Zaid and his team were very fast and prompt at responding to questions posed in the lessons. This is important in a follow along course where some people may have run into coding errors or system errors so they coudln't get the results expected, so for debugging or troubleshooting purposes, I really appreciate the response time. I like reading other people's questions too. Sometimes that can be very useful. \n\nGreat course. Can't believe the different things I know that I didn't know before, though I'm only scratching the surface of the internet and tech, but I also know from this alone I know lots more about tech and security than probably everybody else at the office except the IT guy (who is warning us in simplified terms) of security threats, social engineering, ransomeware, etc. Thinking to myself (\"Oh yeah, that's what we learned how to do a few days ago\" lol). \n\nWhew, now I can give myself a breather before continuing on to my next course, whatever that will be.",

        "review": "Zaid did a great job of interweaving Python with ethical hacking concepts, each building and increasing in depth as you progress through the course. You learn some Kali, Python, and hacking strategies along with some general network principals.  Zaid introduces some Python modules that are powerful, including scapy, response, BeautifulSoup, and regex. \nBuilding a backdoor was the highlight for me and was my first (knowing) exposure to malware. An introduction to BeEF was the scariest. You'll know why if you take the course.\n\nThe course increases in pace. If you've followed closely, you should have no problems with it. The biggest time consumer isn't the material, but getting some modules to install on Kali. If you use the QnA, and Google, you can get through it. Zaid's team is responsive with answering questions. The class has what it calls \"object oriented\" sections, but they really only touch on creating and using classes. You'll find no inheritance, overloading of operators, or anything like that. \n\nUltimately, I would recommend this class to pretty much anyone. Even if you're not into ethical hacking, this class is a great intro to Python. If you are into ethical hacking, you'll revel in the content. I have taken the class as a first step toward preparing for the OSCP and I consider it a great investment. Zaid doesn't give assignments, but offers general ideas and statements about how powerful the code is. Had there been more assignments, or at least some clearer ideas of how to take these concepts and apply them on a borader scale, I would have given this a full 5 starts. Otherwise, it's a solid 4.5.

While that is true, I found that porting everything, if you will, to python 3 and doing my own research on how to make the scripts work with python 3 very challenging and fun. Overall my python grew a lot and I enjoyed the content. Was huge for my portfolio. It would be cool if Zaid made new content, not necessarily going back over all these topics, but maybe introducing new ones exclusively using python 3.

        "review": "Very comprehensive and well-structured course. Covers a huge amount of different different programs, tools and attacks. I really liked the instructor's teaching methods; he managed to explain difficult concepts in a simple manner. His way of teaching programming is fantastic! No boring examples that many programming pages use. This guy teaches Python from scratch by building amazing useful hacking tools. I was a complete rookie but I could follow along and make most of my programs work.\n\nThe course follows a clear and consistent pattern. First, there is a theoretical part explaining how the program or the attack works under the hood. After, there's the implementation part where the instructor codes the program from scratch and explains all the new concepts. Thus, it was easy to follow along.\n\nThe course gives you a great foundation with Python by teaching all the necessary fundamentals. It also teaches you tons of different libraries, so even if you had prior experience there is definitely something new to learn. \n\nThe course support was also good. The instructors answered always within 15 hours as they promise.\n\nThe only negative thing I could find was that there were some outdated sections. Some installations didn't just work like in the videos and I could see from the comments that other students had struggled with same issues I had. For savvy computer wizards this isn't going to be the problem since they can troubleshoot the root cause of the problem, but for beginners this can be really painful.\n\nI also wish that the virtual box installation and configuration was covered in more detail, or at least there were resources provided regarding its configuration. If you are a beginner and fail to configure the virtual box correctly, the course is useless because things don't work like they should. \n\nHowever, I highly recommend this course to everyone. Absolutely worth the money. You will definitely learn something new.",

Don\u2019t be fooled. Still the code doesn\u2019t work in lesson 88 of 176. I have found this course easily the most frustrating I have ever taken. Whenever you have a python coding issue, forget any useful help as it won\u2019t be forthcoming.

Strangely, none of these errors show up in the videos.\nWithout the code working, you are relegated from participant to spectator mode \u2013 trusting \u2013 or not that this joke of a course is for real. \nHaving said all this, the idea of using Ethical hacking to teach python is a great idea, and Zaid\u2019s method of teaching is fantastic, albeit, he misses some commentary on his actions. However, there are more holes in the average teabag that need to be filled, most notably, the lousy, sparse, vague and mostly useless response form the hired tutors. You are mostly fobbed of with vague answers or promises that it will be resolved post https lessons. \nWhat would help \u2013 if the course providers have any integrity, is a link to the code for all of the projects.

Big thanks to the instructor Zaid for making it interesting at the same time. My only concern with this course is that it is not exactly beginner-friendly (as claimed in the course title).

The fact that the  deprecated Python 2 is used, with outdated libraries, doesn't make it easier. This leads to way too many bugs when running the code. I haven't gained programming skills in this course. Simply looking at the code written by Zaid doesn't make me understand the code. The only challenges is to make the Python 2 code work in a modern environment, and that is frustrating. Learning to code in Python 2 is quite confusing when trying to learn Python 3. \n\nThe same applies for the resources provided. Really outdated stuff. It got worse towards the end when starting to create the backdoor script, from installing wine to scan the signatures of the \"evil files\"/malicious files created throughout the course. \n\nI really hope Zaid's Social Engneering course is more up to date, as I've already purchased it.

As well as being a practical hacking course, this would be a great introduction to programming in general as it covers all of the basics. I took Zaid's Ethical Hacking from Scratch course, and that covers how to use existing tools to hack, as well as how to prevent them. This course focuses on implementing your own versions of those tools, and while it doesn't cover as many areas, it focuses on the implementation details so you get a great understanding of what's happening in the background so you can implement your own attacks. That said, it doesn't get lost in details. Zaid does a great job of getting , to the point, delivering concise explanations but always bringing it quickly back to the practical application.

The instructor has done pretty well in other courses with utilities. I had given 5 start rating. I like it. But this course is too disappointing due to the following fact.\n\n1. Source code not available.\n2. Time consuming in googling.\n3. backdoor program will not work if we package in python 3 but i tried and found out work around.

        "review": "Ok so the course was fun and thought provoking since it's my first application-focused-developmet course after i learned python. Zaid is good instructor and the course is well designed. The course has more potential in the exercises section because there's almost none except one exercise; there's even no capstone! I don't like programming courses where the instructor just pour the information and the student has to follow. In fact, I had to skip the arp spoofing detector section and choose it as my capstone to build it independently, and it worked well, with minor differences from Zaid's version. Overall, I love this course.",

Zaid is doing a really good job!\n\nZaids accent may be a challenge for some people, but I got used to it pretty fast.\n\nUPDATE:\nFirst I want to say that the customers support is really amazing!! I got a lot of help especially from James Amaglo and the instructor Zaid Sabih!!\n\nOne possible improvement:\nI think the course is very good already, but it could benefit from a certain didactic method, where you let the students apply what they learnt, before moving on and doing it for them. For example, in Lesson 59, at 2:45, instead of going ahead and just applying what we have learnt before, you could stop and tell the students that they should pause the video and try to do it themselves (to access the \"HTTPRequest\" layer with the \"Path\" and \"Host\" as fields, because we learnt how to access a layer and fields in previous lessons.)",

The main instructor of the video course is very knowledgeable and very easy to understand but there are two main factors for my 3 star review.\n\n1)  Scapy is no longer supported so starting from Lesson 6 and on I was starting to have issues with the programming which would not work.\n\n2)  When addressing items in the QA I keep going into circles with those who are suppose to help me.  Basically asking me the same thing that I already answered in the previous comments.  \n\nSuggestion to make course better.  1)  Perhaps at the end of each lesson have a document that shows the complete code for Python2 and Python3 so students can measure their progress.\n\n2)  I would check to see if there are updates, in this example Scapy was no longer supported in Jan. 2020.  \n\n3)  Please have your QA team read my previous comments before asking the same question over and over.  Or this may be solved if my first suggestion is showcased for students.  \n\nThanks - this course has great potential!\n\nA decent course but I am a little disappointed compared to what I was expecting.\n\nUpdate 10/5 Changed from 3 stars to 2.  Several things wrong:\n\n1)  QA does never addresses my screenshots\n\n2)  The image for Kali installed was to help facilitate learning but in end I didn't see the point considering we still had to download several modules.\n\n3)  When I got to a point in the course the class asked me to download more stuff.\n\nSorry out of all the Udemy classes I have taken this one ended up disappointing me.

This course is pure ethical hacking programming and penetration testing, and I would say that it's one of the very few and best out in the web, that is actually so we'll organized. The amount of information that is gathered in just one course is fenomenal. Not many teachers in the world are actually willing to put effort and time to share knowledge that took time to acquire. Zaid is one of them. The Q/A support is very good as well.\nI don't recommend this course for complete beginners. I would recommend watching or reading about a few python basic concepts and terminology, then taking Zaid's course, and everything will be a lot more clear. Otherwise you migh get confused and disappointed for no reason. Also any reviews that say about how bad the course is etc, are just people trying to learn about cyber security without willing to study any programming languages. Those people are called \"script kiddies\". It's like trying to compose music without willing to study any music theory. It just can't happened.

I have been using Python for over 6 years now, so this review is coming from someone already understanding the language itself. If you are new to Python, stay far away from this course, as you will only get confused.\n\nWhy the bad rating? This course is using an outdated Python version and the support is horrible support, both of which completely reduce the value of this course. \n\nThe creator of the course apparently wanted to \"patch\" an old course by adding some section that translate the code from Python 2 to Python 3, but support for questions regarding Python 3 is non-existent (you will always get \"just use Python 2\"). If you offer sections in Python 3 and advertise a \"makeover\" of the course, you should be willing and able to provide support in that language. I had the feeling that the teaching assistants really just did not want to go through the additional work to actually check any code. \n\nI am currently at Section 10 with a question that has been unresolved for some weeks now (even after frequent follow-ups from my side) and will be dropping this course, as it is just frustrating at this point.",

I think one key advantage in having done these two courses prior to this one, is that I felt a confident to experiment with the code when things didn't go my way and any obstacle I couldn't overcome, I go straight to Google or ask the question and Zaid and his team will always respond. \n\nYou will find as you work through the course that being a problem solver is an essential skill of a programmer, as concepts to do with networks and programming constantly evolve and it's important you are able to adapt before giving up. \n\nAn incredibly in-depth and complex course delivered in a impressively digestible way.",

Hence, I cannot move on with the course.\n \nIn the few hours I watched I did learn some useful concepts and methods, however, there are some blank spots that the trainer does not mention, and you will have to encounter and solve these all by yourself. \nFinally, I want to mention that i always enjoy udemy courses and I am sure that if I am able to solve this scapy.all impasse and continue this course, I will enjoy the rest of it.\n\nSincerely, \nD",

It's very well balanced between a coding course, and a hacking course. \n\nI never write reviews, let alone 5 star reviews.

I am familiar with most of the code so far from before, but I am just so happy to not being stuck with generic \"To-Do list\" tutorials, and I believe this helps a lot, getting real hands on stuff made.",

BUT, as stated in this course, I feel the approach here is brilliant, and gets you coding and in a very useful and practical way, which certainly makes things clearer.\n\nFantastic course, looking forward to the rest of my venture!",

I have seen many python videos online, YouTube, Cybrary and couldn't find anyone taking that approach in teaching.\n\nAlso, you will learn how you can research and teach yourself about new modules that you've never used before and how you can implement them in your code. Something I've struggled with the most when I took Python course in school. \n\nZaid, thank you so much for the awesome course.

Teaching assistant aren't alway sympathetic. I asked one question, answered it on my own, asked another one and got an answer out of nowhere.\n\nI think that Zaid should do a comparative to explain clearly the differences between all his courses.

So please make another section about the basics or tell people to learn the basics themselves this would be so helpful. And I know you talk about the basics in your course but its a small bit of info that really cant help anyone you can teach them about making a variable but they'd only know how to use a variable in only one or two solutions when making their own programs.

Though it doesn't seem to be working on Virtualbox 6.0 or 5.4. \n\nFor a course costing over $100 you'd expect to be able to download the program to actually do the course on a Linux Laptop no less. Which if you read the minimum requirements is included. It's sad that during such tough time that people choose to take advantage of those just wanting to learn. I could of used that money for vital food.
